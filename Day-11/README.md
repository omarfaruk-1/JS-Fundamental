# Closure: 

Closure: Keeps variables alive after outer function ends.

Why Use Closure?  
--> Data Privacy / Encapsulation  
        -> inner function use parent function variable outside the the function.

--> Function Factory / Higher-order Function 
        -> a function return other function which is use parent variable   

--> Maintaining State in Asynchronous Code.(use in loops,timer and event handler)
