# Operators and Expression

--> Operator: symbol + - * / %  
--> Operands: a + b a and b are the operands  
--> Expression: x=2 this is assign expression 2+3=6 this is evaluatdeg expression  


# Arithmetic expression  

let a=12;
let b=5;

let f_name="Omar";
let l_name="Faruk";


console.log(f_name + " " + l_name);

console.log(a+b);  17  
console.log(a-b);  7  
console.log(a*b); 60   
console.log(a/b);  2.4   
console.log(a%b);  2  
console.log(a**b);  248832  

# Increment Decrement  
let count=10;  

--------Post Increment---------  
count++(count +=1) here count value is 10 but after execution this line count value will be 11.  

--------Pre Increment---------
++count here count value is 12  because  before return count it's increment 1.  

--------Post Decrement---------  
count--(count -=1) here count value is 12 but after execution this line count value will be 11.  

--------Pre Decrement---------
++count here count value is 10  because  before return count it's decrement 1.  


# Assignment Operator
let x=5 the value of 5 store in x means the value of x assign 5
